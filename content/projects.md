## Active projects

### 88mph

88mph is a fixed interest rate lending protocol. It's super cool so take a look!

(And yes, the name is a reference to the movie _Back to the Future_. If you haven't seen it you should.)

### Astrodrop

Astrodrop lets users create cheap & massive ERC-20/ERC-721 token airdrops with millions of recipients, using Merkle trees.

It is completely decentralized, since it uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) to store & process the airdrop data.

The coolest part is its usage of [the Graph](https://thegraph.com), which allows users to view all of the airdrops they are eligible for.

## Inactive but still usable projects

### Pool DAI

A no-loss donation protocol enabling people to pool money together, lend it out, and donate the interest to a cause. It uses Compound to generate the interest.

### GetRichQuick

A tool for launching ICOs. It uses DAI to denominate the token price, and offers a customizable ICO page where users can buy your tokens using a nice web interface & Metamask. The ICO page's metadata is hosted on IPFS of course. Also has a referral system for max degen.

## Inactive and unusable projects

### Betoken

Betoken is a crowd-powered asset management protocol. It is essentially a decentralized hedge fund where multiple managers compete in their performance to obtain more governance power of the fund.

### Fantastic12

Fantastic12 is a software suite that enables turning a Discord channel into a DAO. It consists of a Discord bot for making DAO interactions such as voting, as well as a bridge frontend that connects with the user's wallet to publish the interactions onchain.

### Eminem

Eminem is a cheap and dirty frontend for interacting with the Eminence contracts deployed by Andre Cronje in Summer 2020. The contracts were exploited so please don't use it anymore.

### WikiGit

World's first ecosystem for decentralized innovation & cooperation, powered by Ethereum.

TL;DR: WikiGit empowers projects with governing, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding mechanisms, which form reinforcement loops that provide projects with rapid and sustainable growth from their moments of creation.

**Comment**: This was my very first serious project that uses Ethereum. It was a framework that combines a DAO, a Git repo hosted on IPFS, and a bounty system. The idea was and probably still is ahead of its time, but it was far too ambitious for one person to build unfortunately. [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is probably the closest active project to it nowadays, but it still only has the DAO and Git part, not the bounty part.

## Projects by 14-year-old Zefram

They're all written in Objective-C because I was young and foolish, don't judge please.

### RevS

My attempt at a framework for building generalized peer-to-peer applications that could function without a centralized server. It's in the name: "RevS" is short for revolutionize servers. I tried to use it to build a decentralized social network called Chee, but development stalled because I had to graduate from middle school. It was never going to work since the network routing is stupid, as it literally just uses random routes to search for a piece of data (I tried to use finger tables but didn't quite understand them).

This is actually the precise reason I jumped into Ethereum dapp development: it's exactly what I wanted to achieve!

### p2pLazer

This is a P2P networking library (similar in purpose to [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/)) that's taken from RevS. Looking back, it's actually insane that I dove into the weeds of P2P networking and got a pretty good understanding of NATs and techniques to get around them like TCP/UDP hole punching, when I had no business doing so.
