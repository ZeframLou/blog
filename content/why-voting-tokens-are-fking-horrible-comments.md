Just pasting this from our email exchange as it might be interesting to other people reading this.  
  
The first solution I thought was kind of ridiculous at first, but it made sense once I read on and thought about it more.  
Burning them could also give the minting contract additional “supply” to give to workers on the platform,  
Or mint & sell at a higher than initial price if the organization needs a new capital injection.  
The problems I see is that it lacks a price discovery mechanism and wouldn’t work for organizations without sitting capital.  
  
A plausible solution might be to mint a portion of tokens as transferable, have them discover the price and then use  
some sort of a bonding curve style auction for newly minted (as needed) once the non-transferable tokens get burned.  
Maybe 10% in the beginning and then more as the market cap increases and the organization “graduates to publicly owned” (capping at 49%?).  
  
The only direct solution to 51% attack with transferable token voting, I can think of, could be some sort of a debate system to fall back on.  
The core team could veto the vote, make a strong case for or against, and then have a third-party arbitrator decide on the outcome.  
Obviously this is slow/expensive as fuck, and who gets to pick the arbitrator anyway (the legacy system?).  
Optimistically just the risk of the whole debate thing and the court of arbitrators stepping in would deter the attackers from the get-go.  
  
I like the council solutions the most.  
If it’s composed of the best people with a lot of skin in the game, the centralization shouldn’t cause problems (besides making the radical decentralizationist cry).  
But even so, their views and incentives might not be completely aligned with those of end-users in the long run.  
  
A possible solution I see is one where community members could “run” for a seat at the board, up to 49% of the board or something.  
X amount of tokens voted needed for a seat at the board, limited to X seats.  
This would give the token holders a voice while at the same time giving identity to the potential 51% attacker.  
  
This “liquid democracy” type of solution could be useful to implement in any token voting governance model.  
The token holders pick the other influential holders who they believe will represent their interests the best, and pledge them their voting rights.  
It solves the voter apathy and allows for the maintenance of a high quorum requirements – help making the attacks unprofitable.  
  
The best solution ultimately depends not only on the type of organization but also varies issue to issue.
